# satellite-simulator
My graduation project from high school

I wrote this program in early 2015.
It is my first JavaFX project, using google to find out how to use it. I made use of Java FX Scene Builder.
I had a lot of fun making this and I'm proud to mention that this is currently being used in a practical assignment in a physics course of the high school where I graduated.

Here is a video showing a quick overview of the program: https://youtu.be/tfcjnPdfQ44

There is an objective to the program.
The objective is to move the satellite from a current orbit to a new orbit.
This is to be done using:
- An (instant, realistically impossible) speed boost at t = 0;
- Another speed boost at a specified time.

The student is allowed to calculate the required speed boosts, but playing around is also fine.
There is a version that allows up to 10 attempts, where you "win" if you get it within that amount of attempts.
This version can be found in the "game" branch.
